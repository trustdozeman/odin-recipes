        <p>This baked chicken with cream of chicken soup is made with boneless chicken breasts or chicken tenders covered with cream of chicken soup. 
            Chicken, creamy chicken, everywhere! If desired, serve over egg noodles. You may substitute cream of chicken, 
            half-and-half, or water for milk if desired.
